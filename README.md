**SecAudit** is a comprehensive, open-source security assessment platform designed for cybersecurity professionals, penetration testers, and security researchers. It combines multiple security assessment vectors into a unified tool that provides actionable intelligence and detailed reporting.

## 🚀 Features

### Multi-Vector Security Assessment
- **Web Security Analysis**: HTTP security headers, SSL/TLS configuration, server information
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Basic vulnerability detection including XSS, SQL injection, information disclosure
- **Threat Intelligence Integration**: Real-time threat intelligence from multiple free sources
- **Risk Assessment**: CVSS-based vulnerability scoring and overall risk calculation

### Advanced Capabilities
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Executive and technical reports in HTML, JSON, and CSV formats
- **Threat Intelligence Correlation**: Integration with ThreatMiner, URLhaus, and other free feeds
- **Automated Risk Scoring**: CVSS v3.1 calculations with intelligent severity assessment
- **Professional Output**: Color-coded terminal output and detailed logging

### Built for Cybersecurity Community
- **Free and Open Source**: No licensing fees or restrictions
- **Extensible Architecture**: Modular design for easy customization and extension
- **Industry Standards**: Follows OWASP, NIST, and other security frameworks
- **Community Driven**: Designed with input from cybersecurity professionals

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Internet connection (for threat intelligence feeds)
- Target websites/domains for assessment

```bash
# Basic security assessment
python secaudit.py example.com

# Specific scan types
python secaudit.py example.com --scans web vuln threat

# Custom output directory
python secaudit.py example.com --output /path/to/reports
```

### Advanced Usage
```bash
# With custom configuration

## 🔍 Scan Types

### Web Security (`web`)
- HTTP security headers analysis (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- SSL/TLS configuration assessment
- Server information disclosure checks
- Security configuration validation

### Vulnerability Assessment (`vuln`)
- Information disclosure vulnerabilities
- Sensitive file/directory exposure
- Basic injection vulnerability detection
- HTTP method testing
- Security misconfiguration identification

### Threat Intelligence (`threat`)
- ThreatMiner domain and IP analysis
- URLhaus malicious URL checking
- Real-time reputation scoring
- Indicator correlation and enrichment

### Risk Assessment (`risk`)
- CVSS v3.1 vulnerability scoring
- Overall risk calculation
- Priority-based recommendations
- Executive risk summaries

## 📈 Reports

SecAudit generates multiple report formats:

### Executive Summary
- High-level risk overview
- Vulnerability statistics
- Key findings and recommendations
- Business-focused language

### Technical Report
- Detailed vulnerability information
- Technical remediation guidance
- Evidence and proof of concepts
- CVSS scores and analysis

### Data Exports
- **JSON**: Machine-readable results for integration
- **CSV**: Vulnerability data for spreadsheet analysis

## ⚙️ Configuration

Create `secaudit.json` for custom configuration:

```json
{
  "general": {
    "timeout": 30,
    "max_redirects": 5
  },
  "scanning": {
    "max_concurrent_requests": 10,
    "delay_between_requests": 0.1
  },
  "threat_intelligence": {
    "enabled_sources": ["threatminer", "urlhaus"],
    "cache_ttl": 3600
  },
  "reporting": {
    "output_formats": ["html", "json", "csv"],
    "include_executive_summary": true
  }
}
```

## 🔌 API Integration

SecAudit integrates with several free threat intelligence APIs:

- **ThreatMiner**: Domain and IP intelligence
- **URLhaus**: Malicious URL detection
- **MISP**: Threat intelligence platform integration (planned)

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

- **Ethical Use**: Only scan systems you own or have explicit permission to test
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays to avoid overwhelming target systems  
- **No Damage**: Designed for reconnaissance, not exploitation
- **Privacy**: No data collection or external transmission of scan results

## 📝 Logging

SecAudit provides comprehensive logging:

```
logs/
├── secaudit.log          # Main application logs
├── scanner.log           # Vulnerability scanning logs
└── threat_intel.log      # Threat intelligence logs
```
